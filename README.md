# WeatherMap
WeatherMap is an application that gathers weather data from all over the world in a format that is easy to read, control, and adjust courtesy of the collaboration of Map Box and OpenWeather API. With the combinations of Javascript and JQuery, these front-end technologies are the foundation of the application ranging from traversing API’s and general functionality. At the fingertips of the users are a variety of options to find the desired location's weather. One of the most impressive features is a 3D globe with zoomable options that converts  to an 2D format. The map is equipped with a marker to capture precise coordinates. The user also has the ability to traverse the globe using search functionality. Once the user has decided on their location they will be provided with weather data from OpenWeather’s API in said area simultaneously.
